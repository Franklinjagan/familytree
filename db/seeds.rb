I left Streeter Hall at 39 below zero and went down to Boston to join the Navy.\r\n\r\nComing from a seaside town in Mystic, Conn., I was interested in the water, and the Navy appealed to me. I was appointed to the V-12 program and stayed at Dartmouth. My entrance to the Navy meant I moved from Streeter Hall to Lord Hall — that was my big move into the service.\r\n\r\nI was probably the most unprepared person to ever enter Thayer School. I didn’t have physics or chemistry, and I realized I was in over my head. I ended up spending four or five months at Notre Dame training as a midshipman and then I went to sea. I was only 19 when I got my commission. I was a deck officer and a gunnery officer on a big Navy troop ship. I’m listed as a Thayer ’46, but in ’46 I was still at sea. I was devoted entirely to the Navy then.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, I wanted to get back to Dartmouth, so I did in ’46. I was 21 and a junior and decided to study liberal arts. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, I was put on active duty and was assigned to the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Conn., assisting the planner for the U.S.S. Nautilus.

  {person_id: "35", content: "The first record of Robert Fuller in this country was in Salem, MA in 1639 when he requested 5 acres to plant. He is believed to have arrived on the \"Bevis\" which left England in May 1638. England. It was in that year that Governor Winslow ceased to record the arrival of ships, there being so many, 20 in that year with over 3000 persons. Perhaps Robert and his brother Thomas of Woburn slipped in among that large group of unrecorded persons. It is known they came from England. Robert Fuller was a bricklayer by trade. In those days the mason gathered, hauled and cleaned his stone for construction. Usually stone was used for the foundation, chimneys, and cellar walls. At some point he moved from Salem to Rehoboth. He owned property there in 1645. His wife, Sarah Bowen had sisters and brothers already living in Rehoboth. Of Robert Fuller family and his early descendants it is said:\r\n\r\n\"The Fuller families were of strong Puritanical character; marked for integrity, industry, a strict regard for truth and justice, accompanied by an affability or manners both pleasing and of controlling influence.\"\r\n\r\nRobert FULLER Of Salem and Rehoboth was born about 1616 in Southampton, Hampshire, England. He died on 10 May 1706 in Rehoboth, Bristol, Massachusetts. Robert Fuller was born about 1615 perhaps in Suffolk or Norfolk county near the southeastern coast of England. Most everyone with the surname of \"Fuller\" lived in this region when the name first came into use because it was where the woolen cloth manufacturers were located. The name comes from the trade of \"fuller.\" A fuller's job was important to the refinement of finished cloth. A fuller scoured wool and other cloth after it was woven to make it whiter, tighter, thicker, and more durable. In part of his process, the fuller would sprinkle the woven cloth with a clay called \"fuller's earth\", then fold and soak the cloth in a tub of water. While in the tub, he would walk on the cloth with his bare feet to even out the fill. In 1638, Robert Fuller is said to have sailed from the port of Southampton to Salem, which was in the English-chartered, Massachusetts Bay Colony. His passage was probably on the ship \"Bevis of Hampton.\" The Bevis made only one voyage to America and Robert's name does not appear in the ship's manifest. However, he may have worked for his passage as an ordinary seaman, in which case, his name would not have appeared among those of the regular passengers.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his arrival, colonial Salem was twelve years old. There were already several other Fullers living in Massachusetts when Robert arrived. Some had sailed with the Puritans from England to Plymouth Rock in 1620 on the Mayflower. It has not been shown using civil records that Robert was in fact related to these other Fullers, but it is remotely possible. If Robert was related to brothers Samuel and Edward Fuller, or Susanna (Fuller) White of the Mayflower, then he was probably a nephew. If so, he would have been the son of Thomas Fuller, who remained in England. Robert may also have had an older brother named Thomas who came to Massachusetts in 1638, but lived first in Woburn and then in Salem. Again, no proof has been found yet of this relationship.\r\n\r\nRobert married Sarah Bowen at Salem in about 1639. She was born in Wales in about 1616 to Richard and Ann Bowen. The entire Bowen family was living in Salem--already a busy seaport--by the time Robert arrived. In 1645, however, Robert was given land in Rehoboth, which was in an unsettled area to the southwest of Salem about 60 miles away. By 1650, he had moved his family there. Robert and Sarah had six children: Jonathan, Elizabeth, John, Samuel, Abigail, and Benjamin. He and Sarah built a new home at the southwest end of a scenic area called the \"Ring of Green\" which was on the Seekonk plain. The family lived there for about the next twenty-five years, until serious problems with Indian attacks made life there intolerable. Today this land is part of East Providence, Rhode Island. During his first years in America, Robert made his living as a bricklayer. He is mentioned many times in this regard in the early records of Town meetings of both Salem and Rehoboth. In those days, a bricklayer's job consisted mainly of building fireplaces, bake ovens, chimneys, foundations, and cellar walls. Houses were not generally brick, but were back-plastered with lime on the walls and ceilings for greater warmth. At first, a bricklayer in Massachusetts had his pay set by the Court of Assistants; In 1630, the order had been that carpenters, joiners, sawyers, bricklayers, and thatchers could be paid no more than two shillings a day. This order was repealed, however, because it failed to promote the skilled labor which was vital to the growing colony. Robert did not become a \"freeman\" until 1655. Unless you were granted the status of freeman, you could not vote or hold public office. In order to be a freeman in the Plymouth Colony, however, you had to be approved by the minister of the congregation--in Massachusetts this meant you had to be a Puritan. Indeed, Robert was a loyal Congregationalist, and received his grant. Later, in 1668, he and his brother-in-law were elected constables for one year. \"Att the General Court of Elections held att Plymouth the third Day of June, Anno Dom 1668, Prence Gour, Constables of Rehoboth-- Robert ffuller George Kendricke\" Constables kept the peace, made arrests, served warrants, and among other popular activities, collected taxes. In 1675 and 1676, Rehoboth was attacked several times by the Wampanoag Indians in what was called \"King Philip's War.\" Scores of townspeople were ambushed in the fields or killed in surprise attacks by angry natives. King Philip, or \"Metacomet\" (which was his Indian name), was the son of Massasoit, chief of the Wampanog tribe. Apparently, the Indians had become increasingly angry with the encroachments of the early settlers, and resorted to violence. As a result of these attacks, Robert lost his wife, Sarah, and three of his children, John, Samuel, and Abigail. His daughter Elizabeth lost her husband, Nehemiah Sabin. Shortly after these tragic losses, Robert returned to Salem. Soon he remarried to Margaret Waller, whose husband had also been killed. Margaret and Robert lived in Salem until the late 1690s. Fortunately for them, they were not among the 125 persons accused of witchcraft in 1692. After trial, many witches were hanged. (None was ever burned.) The governor of the Massachusetts colony finally put a stop to the incredible nonsense in 1693. Eventually, Robert went back to Rehoboth to live out his last years with his grown children. Margaret died about 1700 and Robert in 1706. They are both probably buried in the oldest cemetery in Rehoboth.\r\n\r\n[Much of the above was based on information provided by Clarence C. Fuller in his book \"Robert Fuller of Salem\"] He was married to Sarah BOWEN in 1639 in Salem, Massachusetts Bay Colony.\r\n\r\nArrived in colonies aboard the \"Bevis\" which left England in May 1638. First record in this country is in Salem, MA where on 18 Nov. 1639 he requested 5 acres of land on which to garden Robert was a bricklayer, or mason, and had many opportunites to ply his trade as the town of Salem was growing rapidly. Foundations and basements were usually constructed of field stone which was gathered, cleaned and hauled by the mason. The mason also mined or dug and hauled the lime used as mortar. No record of his marriage is found, although Newton Fuller in his Fuller Memorial lists the names of Robert's wife and children. According to the records Robert owned land in Rehoboth in 1645 where is wife, Sarah Bowen had sisters and brothers already living. He worked in both communities and were living in Rehoboth by 1652. Her father, Richard Bowen, b. abt 1590 and his second wife were among the first settlers there having emigrated from Kittle Hill, Glamorganshire, Wales, England via Weymouth, MA. before moving on to Rehoboth. So far as we know Robert was a loyal Congregationalist, and may have felt that his allegiance to his church precluded his declaring his allegiance to the state. He twice proposed taking up his freedom, but delayed taking the oath of fidelity for six years. Along with hihs brother-in-law, George Kendrick, Robert was elected a constable in 1668. Their duties included keeping the pace, making arrests, serving warrants, and the collection of taxes. Since there was very little cash in those days they were reuired to accept payment in produce at rates set by the town council. The handling of such produdce made the collection of taxes an arduous task. The King Phillips war began in Swansea, MA 23 June1675, when a merchant had his son shoot a pilfering Indian. Next day a band of Phillips Indians attacked killing the merchant and his son as well as other inhabitants. Massasoit, the chief who had befriended the settlerswas sachem of the Warpanoag Tribe had died in 1662. His eldest son, Wamsutta became sachem in his stead but died a year later. Metacomet (Phillip) another son they reigned as sachem. The Indians resented the efforts to convert them to the English religeon and to force them to live by English law, so Phillip formed an alliance with other tribes and determined to drive the English out of the country. To finance the war the colonists were asked to contribute money. People of Rehoboth contributed 570 pounds. Robert Fuller contributed 4 pounds-10 shillins-3 pence. In addition to financia costs were the cost of lives.Robert lost his wife, two sons, and a son-in-law. His daughter Abigail was also thought to have been killed by the Indians.\r\n\r\nSource of Notes: \"Chumbley / Crook Ancestors\" (Contact: Glenna Chumbley; Updated: 2004-06-11 02:17:02 UTC (Fri))"},
  {person_id: "49", content: "Rev. James Noyes was born in 1608. He entered Oxford (Brasenose College) in 1627 but did not complete a degree: he was invited by his cousin and former teacher, Rev. Thomas Parker, to teach with him at the Free School in Newbury, England [a town in Berkshire on the river Kennet, about 56 miles west from London], which they did together before coming to New England. (James Noyes was reported to be especially masterful in Greek and later wrote several learned treatises concerning religious subjects.) He married (in 1633) Sarah Brown of Southampton, England.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames Noyes, with his wife Sarah, his younger brother Nicholas, and his cousin Thomas Parker left for Massachusetts on March, 1633. He preached in the Boston area at Medford, MA (then, Mystic, MA), was made freeman on 3 Sept., 1634, and was (with Nicholas and Thomas Parker) among the first settlers of Newbury, MA.\r\nThe settlement in Newbury, which provided free land, continued a policy by the Governors of Massachusetts to extend the northern frontiers rapidly, in part because of apprehension concerning potential French expansion into unsettled territory. The settlement was named for their earlier place of residence in England, and the Parker River was named in honor of Rev. Parker.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Thomas Parker and Rev. James Noyes, and other early settlers, formed the First Parish Church of Newbury, with Rev. Parker the senior pastor and Rev. Noyes his assistant (\"Teacher\") shortly after their arrival. The current Church building, built in the mid-19th century, stands on the left of Route 1A, traveling north from Boston, just past the Upper Green, and about 3 miles beyond the bridge across the Parker River and the Lower Green.\r\nThe first settlers were enthusiastic about the New World and sent word back to England; eventually more than 100 friends and neighbors from their region of England came to the Newbury area.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe settlement grew rapidly and, after about ten years, the Upper Green was cleared to become the center of Newbury. Reverend James Noyes built a house for his family nearby, at 5 Parker St., which still stands; it was the home, also, of Rev. Thomas Parker who never married.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf early historical interest is the role that Rev. James Noyes of Stonington CT, the native-born second son of the first Rev. James Noyes, played in the founding of Yale College. He was one of the seven founding ministers (and the name Noyes is inscribed, today, on Woodbridge Hall, the Administration Building, above and to the right of the front door.) This Rev. Noyes also was the first Senior Fellow (Chair) of the Board of Trustees, and his younger brother Moses also served as a member of the Trustees.\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. James Noyes and his wife had eight children: Joseph (1637), (Rev.) James (1640), Sarah (1641), Moses (1643), John (1645), Thomas (1648), Rebecca (1651), William (1653), and Sarah (1656). (Also of early historical interest is that the youngest daughter, Sarah, married John Hale; among their descendants was Nathan Hale, the \"hero spy.\") Rev. James Noyes died on 22 October 1656; he is buried in the First Burial Ground of the Church he helped to establish."},
  {person_id: "51", content: "Rev. William Noyes (1568–1622) was an English clergyman, Rector of Cholderton, Wiltshire, England. He died before 30 April 1622, in Cholderton. He was matriculated, age 20, at University College, Oxford, 15 November 1588, being admitted to the B.A. degree 31 May 1592. He was instituted rector of Cholderton in 1601, according to the Salisbury \"Diocesan Register\".\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Cotton Mather, pastor of the North Church in Boston, provides an insight into the character of William Noyes while describing, from a contemporary viewpoint, the early education of Ann's nephew, Rev. Thomas Parker . \"This Mr. Thomas Parker was the only son of his father, who was very desirous to have him a scholar, committed him unto perhaps a godly, but a very severe master [Rev. William Noyes]. Under this hard master, though he was well nigh discouraged by the dulness which he apprehended in his own capacity, yet the consideration of his father's desire made him, with an early piety, to join his prayers unto his pains, that he might have his education prospered; and God so prospered him, that he arrived unto a desirable degree of knowledge, both in tongues and in arts.\" [Magnalia Christi Americana (Hartford, 1855), 1:480–488].\r\n\r\nWilliam's grandson, Rev. Nicholas Noyes, of Salem, Massachusetts, told Rev. Cotton Mather that his grandfather was \"a very learned man\", whose wife was the sister-in-law of the learned Mr. Robert Parker.\r\n\r\nSavage: The register of the Diocese shows that he officiated in the Parish from 1602 to 1620, at which time he resigned. [This is in error as noted below.] In 1621, he was succeeded as rector by his son Nathan. Despite his scholarly ways, either Rev. William Noyes failed to keep a parish register for Cholderton, or the book has been lost. When Mr. Samuel Heskins became rector in 1651, he felt it necessary to begin a new book and recorded somewhat erroneous information concerning William and his son Nathan. In the NEHG Register, Vol. 42, October 1888, p. 403 Edward Deering Noyes received a letter from the current Rector of Cholderton, Rev. Edwin P. Barrow in which is the following extract from the Registry Book: \"Mr. William Noyes Rector of Choldington about 30 years departed this life anno 1616. Mr. Nathan Noyes succeeded his father in the Rectorie of Choldrington and departed this life in ye year 1651.\" Among the burials extracted from the register is \"Mrs. Anne Noyes, widow & Relict of Mr. William Noyes sometime Rector of Choldrington, March 7, 1657, age 82. The present parish register was begun only in 1651, but a complete list of the incumbents from 1297 is preserved in the Salisbury Diocesan Register. The following records are taken from the \"Parish Notes,\" published in 1889 by Rev. Edwin P. Barrow, the then rector.\r\n\r\n\"The Church of St. Nicholas, Cheldreton, was given to the Monks of St. Neots (Huntingdonshire) about 1175 by Roger Burnard, and the grant was confirmed by Pope Alexander III. In 1380, 1399 and 1401 John Skylling, lord of the manor, was also patron of the church, probably by temporary grants from the Convent. In 1445 it was again in St. Neots' Priory, but seems to have been finally alienated to John Skylling about 1449.\" Through several patrons it came to Sir Thomas Lovell, lord of the manor, in 1492 and 1494. John Thornborough was patron in 1567, and by him and Giles Hutchins the living was given to William Noyes. Rev. William Noyes became rector just before the death of Elizabeth I of England and held the living until his death. In 1840, the old church was pulled down.\r\n\r\nRev. William Noyes died intestate before 30 April 1622, when an inventory of his estate was made, 28 May 1622. His widow Anne (Stephens) Noyes was appointed administratrix (Court of Archdeacon of Sarum). She took administration with a bond, dated 28 May 1622 and co-signed in a well-educated hand by Cuthbert Parker, yeoman, of Whitchbury, Hampshire, both used heraldic seals. Anne (Stephens) Noyes died aged 82 years, was buried at Choulderton, 7 March 1657. Her will is at Somerset House, London, and mentions two sons, James and Nicholas in New England.\r\n\r\nFamily[edit]\r\nWilliam Noyes was the son of Robert Noyes (1524–1614) and Joan Attridge (1527–1618) of Urchfont, Wiltshire, England. His brother, Richard Noyes, of Cholderton, yeoman, made his will 25 Aug 1639, in which he mentions widow Sara. Another brother, Robert Noyes, yeoman, born in 1570, died 20 January 1659, and was buried at Cholderton. The will of Richard Noyes of Manningford Bruce, in the diocese of Sarum, 2 February 1590, mentions \"the sons of Robert Noyes of Cholderton.\" This Robert may have been the father of William, Richard, and Robert Noyes. Richard Noyes of Manningford Bruce was son of William Noyes of Urchfont, yeoman (will 1557), who purchased the prebend of Urchfont in 1540, from the Earl of Hertford, afterwards Protector Somerset. The Noyes family of Urchfont was of the same stock as that of Cholderton.\r\n\r\nWilliam Noyes married Anne Stephens about 1595, daughter of Nicholas Stephens, Esq. of Burdop Manor and Frances Brydges. Anne's sister Dorothy Stephens was the wife of Rev. Robert Parker, MA and mother of Rev. Thomas Parker. (see Wheeler, History of Stonington, Connecticut) Their mother, Frances Brydges was the daughter of Lady Jane Spencer and Sir Richard Brydges, Kt. and grand daughter of Sir William Spencer, Kt. (1483–1532) of Wormleighton & Althorp, Northamptonshire, England. His descendants of the Spencer family include the Earls Spencer and Winston Churchill.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Anne were the parents of the following children.\r\n\r\nEphraim Noyes, born c. 1596, Cholderton, Wiltshire, England, died date unknown. He married Parnell Brewer 5 November 1633 in Orcheston St Mary, Wiltshire, England. She was born c. 1613 in Wiltshire, England.\r\nRev.

She was born c. 1600 in Wiltshire, England, and died after 6 September 1651 in Sarum, Witlshire, England possibly when she was mentioned in her husband's will.\r\nJohn Noyes, born c. 1600, Cholderton, Wiltshire, England, died 1659 in Newton, Wiltshire, England. He married Elizabeth Bulpit 3 February 1640/41 in Faccombe, Hampshire, England.\r\n(Daughter) Noyes, born c. 1604, died 1655. She married Robert Read c. 1624 in Wiltshire, England.\r\nSarah Noyes, born c. 1605, died unknown.\r\nRev. James Noyes, born 22 October 1608, Cholderton, Wiltshire, England, died 22 October 1656, Newbury, Essex, Massachusetts. With his cousin Rev. Thomas Parker he led a group of 100 Wiltshire settlers aboard the Mary & John to New England and founded Newbury, Massachusetts. Before migrating to the New England, he married Miss Sara Brown in March 1633/34 in Cholderton, Wiltshire, England, eldest daughter of Mr. Joseph and Mrs. Sarah Brown of Southampton. She was born 1610 in Southampton, Hampshire, England, and died 13 September 1691 in Newbury Old Town, Essex, Massachusetts.\r\nMowit Noyes, born 1613 in Cholderton, Wiltshire, England, died 6 October 1671. She married Thomas Kent 23 September 1631 in Over Wallop, Hampshire, England.\r\nDeacon Nicholas Noyes, born 1614, Cholderton, Wiltshire, England, died 23 November 1701, Newbury, Essex, Massachusetts. He was Deacon of Newbury church, and served four terms as deputy to the general court. In 1640 he married Mary Cutting in Newbury Old Town, Essex, Massachusetts, daughter of John and Mary Cutting. She was born c. 1619, and died after 23 June 1665. With his older brother James and cousin Rev. Thomas Parker, Nicholas led a group of Wiltshire settlers aboard the Mary & John to New England to found Newbury, Massachusetts.\r\nAnne Noyes, born 16 December 1617, Cholderton, Wiltshire, England, died before 1711.\r\nNotes[edit]\r\nAnne (Stephens or Parker), wife of Rev. William Noyes, Cholderton, England circa 1568.\r\n\r\n\"Genealogical Record of Some of the Noyes Descendants of James, Nicholas and Peter Noyes\" (Volume 1, Descendants of Nicholas Noyes) Collected and compiled by Col. Henry E. Noyes, USA and Miss Harriette E. Noyes – Members of NEHGS – Boston 1904. Miss Harriette E. Noyes was aware that Anne Stephens was thought by some to be the wife of Rev. William Noyes, as she makes reference to it on Page 45 of Vol. I. At the time of publication, it was their opinion that that information was erroneous. However, further investigation subsequent to the printing of the book, it was proved that information to be correct. The correction was published in 1906 as follows:\r\n\r\n8861. 2. Noyes. R.W. N., 22 Oct 1906. The \"Additional Corrections and Additions,\" page 3, of Wheeler's \"History of Stonington, Conn.\" has the following: \"Miss Harriet E. Noyes of New Hampshire says: 'From recent investigations in England the name of Rev. William Noyes's wife was proven to be Anne Stephens, daughter of Nicholas Stephens of Burdrop Manor, and sister of Dorothy Stephens, mother of Rev. Thomas Parker.'\" M. G.
